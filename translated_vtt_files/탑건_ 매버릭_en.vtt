What's the matter?

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.419
What?

20
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.720
The order to stop is to destroy the test program.

21
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.960
It didn't meet headquarters' expectations.

22
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.240
The contract target is Mach 10.

23
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.440
You can achieve it within 2 months. Today's record was Mach 9.

He's coming to finish our test himself.

You haven't arrived yet

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.299

"Maverick"

34
00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:26.159
Don't forget, the contract target is Mach 10

35
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.700
Not 10.1 or 10.2, just Mach 10

36
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.800
Only then can we save this program.

37
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.300
Don't make that face

38
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.840
It's always like this

39
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.360
Control tower, can you hear me clearly from Darkstar?

40
00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:53.820
It sounds very good, what about that?

41
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.860
I hear you well, takeoff check completed.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.880
Maverick, Kane just arrived.

59
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.040
You can quit now, my friend.

60
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.760
You know what will happen if you push ahead here.

61
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.380
If we don't do it now, everyone knows what's going to happen.

62
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.640
Darkstar, ready for takeoff

63
00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.780
Everyone

64
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.540
Let's take off, engines first

65
00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:02.400
- Check engine - Check temperature

66
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.560
- Check fuel - Check electricity

67
00:08:04.679 --> 00:08:06.000
Control surface check

68
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.760
Darkstar is cleared for takeoff.

69
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.380
It was good

70
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.240
Let's go one last time

71
00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:42.000
Dark Star, approved for over 180 meters, increase to Mach 3.5

72
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.900
Climb over 180 meters and accelerate to Mach 3.5

Admiral

74
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.640
- You came just in time. - I was in a hurry and so were you.

75
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.140
Could you please explain?

76
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.180
Conversion to scramjet engines

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.260
Maverick, the Admiral's request...

80
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.540
- It's an order. - It's an order. You have to come down.

81
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.319
Alpha, 3…

82
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.740
Container… 5.4…

83
00:09:25.859 --> 00:09:27.300
To 6…

84
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.460
There is always a communication problem around this time.

85
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.920
It's called 'Earth Bulge' because of the curvature of the Earth's surface.

86
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.480
Didn't you even give me coffee?

87
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.120
All right

88
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.819
"Mach"

89
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.780
Currently increasing to Mach 7 8

90
00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:48.060
- What is your flight record? - Receiving, OK

91
00:09:53.339 --> 00:09:55.859
Stable engine response when fuel temperature rises

92
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.300
Good condition

Mach 9

96
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.440
I'm the fastest human in the world

97
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.319
Tell me, Goose.

98
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.439
Mach 9.1

Aircraft surface temperature is rising

105
00:11:19.439 --> 00:11:21.360
Please, just hold on a little longer.

106
00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:23.220
A little bit…

107
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.900
Please!

108
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.400
Please!

109
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.939
Mach 10!

110
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.439
Look at it! What are budget cuts?

111
00:11:48.359 --> 00:11:49.560
Admiral

112
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.340
Please do not do that

113
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.420
A little bit

114
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.500
If you do more...

115
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.380
Shit

116
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.920
You have a lot of guts

117
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.420
I admit that

118
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.560
"warning"

119
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.060
This

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.840
Thank you

125
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.819
Where am I?

126
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.640
Earth

127
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.880

Maverick

130
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.819
Over 30 years of service

131
00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.400
Many battle medals

132
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.839
Commendation for military service

133
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.940
The only pilot in the last 40 years to shoot down three enemy planes.

134
00:14:06.599 --> 00:14:07.979
Distinguished Service Medal

135
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.640
Distinguished Service Medal, Distinguished Service Medal

136
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.680
But I wasn't promoted and I wasn't discharged.

137
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.800
Flying a fighter jet like I'm dying but I'm still alive

138
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.420
You should be an admiral by now, but if you're not a senator, you should be fine.

139
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.640
Still

140
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.340
Colonel

141
00:14:30.479 --> 00:14:31.800
What happened?

142
00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:34.200
I'm curious about that too

143
00:14:34.319 --> 00:14:37.800
I wasn't joking, I was asking a question.

144
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.460
I'm happy with where I am now

145
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.699
The Navy thinks differently.

146
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.800
Now…

147
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.040
The fighter planes you're testing.

148
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.780
Colonel

149
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.380
There will come a day when we won't need pilots

150
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.460
Eat, sleep and sleep

151
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.840
Pilots who disobey orders

152
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.220
Although you bought yourself some time.

153
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.520
In the coming future

154
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.400
There's no room for you

155
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.420
Get it out of the camp

156
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.939
I waited at the hotel while I packed my bags.

157
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.400
Delivered to North Island within 1 hour

158
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.200
You mean North Island?

159
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.620
I received a call at perfect timing.

160
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.340
I was on my way to end your pilot career.

161
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.360
It's annoying to say this, but

162
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.520
I don't know why, but I wonder if there is a guardian spirit...

163
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.960
I returned to Top Gun

164
00:15:59.099 --> 00:16:02.520
- yes? - Let's go, Colonel.

165
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.719
The end will come, Maverick

166
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.540
The pilot will disappear

167
00:16:16.199 --> 00:16:17.700
Maybe so

168
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.000
But not today

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.440
I've heard of your reputation

174
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:33.780
Thank you

175
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.540
It's not a compliment

176
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.360
I'm Admiral Bo Simpson

177
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.580
You know Admiral Bates, the Pacific Fleet air commander?

178
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.260
Warlock, Admiral

179
00:17:43.379 --> 00:17:46.080
I didn't know you would invite me again.

180
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.000
Those are called orders, Maverick.

181
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.879
Admiral, you and I have something in common.

182
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.760
Cyclone was also a senior in 1988.

183
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.800
Actually, I graduated second in class.

184
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.440
I'm afraid you're expecting too much.

185
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.900
The attack target is...

186
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.760
To an unlicensed uranium enrichment facility.

187
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.280
Its very existence is a violation of the NATO treaty.

188
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.340
The uranium produced there is

189
00:18:14.399 --> 00:18:15.720
It is also a direct threat to neighboring friendly countries.

190
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.040
Form an air raid team and order them to eliminate the factory before it operates.

191
00:18:20.159 --> 00:18:21.840
It's an order from the Ministry of Defense.

192
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.760
The location of the facility is an underground bunker at the end of this canyon.

193
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.500
The canyon is a GPS disturbance area.

194
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.379
Surface-to-air missiles are densely deployed.

195
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.139
There are a small number of 5th generation fighters and

196
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.220
A number of support fighters were also confirmed

197
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.560
I have some old F-14s too.

198
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.960
We're not the only ones obsessed with artifacts.

199
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.260
What do you think, Colonel?

200
00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:52.200
It would be easy with the F-35 stealth plane.

201
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.020
It's difficult because I can't find the GPS.

202
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.860
Surface-to-air missiles require low-altitude laser-guided airstrikes.

203
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.360
The F-18 is perfect

204
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.440
I think

205
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.080
For at least two precision bombings

206
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.660
You need 4 units in 2 groups of 2 each.

207
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.420
The slope here is too steep

208
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.820
We'll all be exposed to surface-to-air missiles.

209
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.800
Even if I pass that

210
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.679
There will be dogfights until we return

211
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.380
These are all things you have experienced yourself.

212
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.200
It wasn't a single operation.

213
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.980
No

214
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.260
Someone will lose their life

215
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.820
Is it possible or not?

216
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.280
How much time will there be before the facility is operational?

217
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.200
3 weeks, maybe faster

218
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.160
It's been a while since I flew an F-18.

219
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.639
I don't know who I'll pick for the other three.

220
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.860
I will make it a success

221
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.600
I think there's a misunderstanding, Colonel.

222
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.159
Yes?

223
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.459
I'm not telling you to do it, I'm telling you to teach it.

224
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.720
Teach?

225
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.760
We brought back 12 of the Top Gun alumni.

226
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.520
Let's take six here

227
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.800
They're going to carry out the operation.

228
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.919
Is there a problem, Colonel?

229
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.120
You know

230
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.160
Okay

231
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.340
Bradley Bradshaw call sign, Rooster

232
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.260
You were on a team with his father.

233
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.120
What is your call sign?

234
00:20:24.899 --> 00:20:26.520
This is Goose

235
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.960
It was a tragedy

236
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.939
Colonel Mitchell did nothing wrong.

237
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.860
Goose's death was an accident

238
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.540
Is that what you think too?

239
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.760
Does Goose’s son think so too?

240
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.760
Sorry, I'm not a teacher.

241
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.500
You were a Top Gun instructor, right?

242
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.020
It was 30 years ago and it was only 2 months.

243
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.340
It's not my place

244
00:20:47.399 --> 00:20:49.560
I say it bluntly

245
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.920
My choice wasn't you, in fact you weren't even a candidate.

246
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.280
I called you at the request of Admiral Kazansky.

247
00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.659
The Iceman I deeply respect is

248
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.720
Looks like you have some work left to do in the Navy.

249
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.660
Is it really so?

250
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.960
You don't have to take it

251
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.340
But this

252
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.340
This will be your last mission.

253
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.500
Either teach at Top Gun or get discharged.

254
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.939
$20 for not being able to do 3 in a row

255
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.520
"Ice: That didn't work out"

256
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.240
“He’s still not good enough for this operation.”

257
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.580
"Ice is typing"

258
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.800
“Everyone is like that”

259
00:21:55.919 --> 00:21:57.960
“That’s why I called you.”

260
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.860
“Please tell me in advance.”

261
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.920
“Would you have come if that were the case?”

262
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.560
Nonsense

263
00:22:16.139 --> 00:22:17.220
Feet

264
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.740
Penny?

265
00:22:20.699 --> 00:22:24.120
-What's going on here? - I should ask.

266
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.540
- It's a long story - It can't be.

267
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.360
Who did you piss off again this time?

268
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.860
Another admiral

269
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.940
I guess so

270
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.800
- Are you mad at me? - feet

271
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.940
I can't be angry at you for long, that's the problem

272
00:22:43.379 --> 00:22:44.700
Just…

273
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.300
I thought I'd never run into you in this neighborhood

274
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.780
- How long have you been here? - I took over this place 3 years ago.

275
00:22:51.899 --> 00:22:53.700
- 3 years? - huh

276
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.320
Right after you pissed off another admiral and got kicked out into the desert.

277
00:22:59.219 --> 00:23:01.320
That was 3 years ago?

278
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.620
I think I had a serious accident

279
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.320
There's no way I came here on my own

280
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.140
Anyway…

281
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.540
We'll solve it again

282
00:23:13.199 --> 00:23:14.460
No, this time...

283
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.300
- I think it's the end. - That's ridiculous, Pete.

284
00:23:18.419 --> 00:23:21.180
You always lived with that sound.

285
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.840
He said that when he caught me on the F-18.

286
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.840
As far as I know, he went to Bosnia

287
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.080
I've been to Iraq, twice

288
00:23:31.139 --> 00:23:32.760
If you have an accident

289
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.780
Iceman saved him and he flew again.

290
00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:38.400
It's different this time

291
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.020
Trust me, Pete.

292
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.360
Even if it seems impossible now

293
00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.780
I guess I'll be flying a fighter jet again somehow.

294
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.900
- Penny... - late

295
00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:49.860
What?

296
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.080
I was going to ask what time it ends.

297
00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.360
Don't make that face

298
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.959
No facial expressions, I swear

299
00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:04.200
We always ended up the same

300
00:24:05.699 --> 00:24:07.500
Let's not start this time

301
00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.780
Okay

302
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.700
Okay

303
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.879
Looks good

304
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.640
Thank you

305
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.480
What's the matter?

306
00:24:38.879 --> 00:24:42.840
'If you disparage women or the Navy or leave your cell phone on the bar'

307
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.760
‘Buy one drink at a time’

308
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.500
All these people?

309
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.320
Sorry, that's the rule. I'm glad it's early.

310
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.139
Nonsense

311
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.720
Who the hell is this?

312
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.680
Isn't it Phoenix?

313
00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.139
I thought only special people came

314
00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.460
Was anyone coming?

315
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.860
Everyone, this is Bagman.

316
00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.720
- Hangman - That's it.

317
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.540
The only one with experience shooting down enemy planes

318
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.100
Active Navy Pilot

319
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.000
Stop

320
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.080
The opponent was driving an antique that had been deployed in the Korean War.

321
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.960
- It's a cold war. - They're both old.

322
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.040
Because it's already the last century

323
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.480
Who are your friends?

324
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.580
- Payback - Fanboy

325
00:25:26.639 --> 00:25:28.680
- Hello, Coyote - Nice to meet you.

326
00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.300
-Who is he? - who?

327
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.680
When did you come?

328
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.380
It was still there

329
00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.080
- He's a stealth pilot. - Really.

330
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.540
A weapons controller to be exact.

331
00:25:43.199 --> 00:25:44.639
You have no sense of humor

332
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.760
What do you call it?

333
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.800
Rice

334
00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.120
Not your name, but your call sign

335
00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.080
Rice

336
00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.460
Bob floyd

337
00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.180
Is it you who rides behind me? From the Lemoore base?

338
00:26:01.379 --> 00:26:03.060
I think that's right

339
00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.980
It's nine ball

340
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.540
Start

341
00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.840
Of course

342
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.480
- Hi, Penny. - Yeah.

343
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.760
4 more bottles for you.

344
00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.820
Bradshaw!

345
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.340
Is it really you?

346
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.080
You didn't contact me while you were in the country?

347
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.060
I tried to surprise you

348
00:26:50.879 --> 00:26:52.980
You seem surprised too?

349
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.520
- It's good to see you again - Me too.

350
00:26:59.219 --> 00:27:00.959
- here - thank you

351
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.760
Thank you, uncle.

352
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.379
Can you pay before the customers flock in?

353
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.440
Bradshaw

354
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.120
Are you surprised?

355
00:27:30.959 --> 00:27:31.920
Hangman

356
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.200
Looks good

357
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.139
Okay, Rooster.

358
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:39.960
Very good

359
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.060
Actually

360
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.980
It's great so I'm going to ride it

361
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.300
So

362
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.940
Does anyone know what this special dispatch is?

363
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.060
The operation is there, I don't care.

364
00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.780
What I'm curious about is who will be the team leader.

365
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.460
I'm asking who has the skills to be my subordinate.

366
00:28:00.959 --> 00:28:04.500
Hangman, if you become the leader, the team will fail.

367
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.100
The team of which you are the leader is probably... Will it end if I hesitate?

368
00:28:17.879 --> 00:28:20.220
Is that you, Rooster?

369
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.520
Sitting on a perch like a chicken

370
00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.800
I'm waiting for the time to come

371
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.219
It never comes

372
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.560
I love this song!

373
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.379
Nothing has changed

374
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.620
Yeah, not at all

375
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.260
Look over there

376
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.420
There's more

377
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.080
Harvard, Yale, Omaha and even Fritz!

378
00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.360
So what is the mission?

379
00:29:01.379 --> 00:29:03.360
That's not the problem

380
00:29:04.139 --> 00:29:06.180
We are already the best

381
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.600
Who on earth is teaching us?

382
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.580
Card authorization was declined

383
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.020
Nonsense

384
00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:33.960
Let's go

385
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.139
With this...

386
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.139
I don't even have a chin

387
00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.939
I'll bring cash tomorrow

388
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.660
Rules are rules, Pete.

389
00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.240
Throw it! Throw it!

390
00:30:13.199 --> 00:30:14.460
Is it like this?

391
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.540
Throw it, throw it!

392
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:25.680
Throw it, throw it!

393
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.659
Nice to meet you, Pete!

394
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.139
Throw it, throw it!

395
00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.940
Throw it!

396
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.139
Thanks for the beer, come again!

397
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.300
My whole body is shaking and my head is pounding.

398
00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.240
When love gets too strong, people go crazy

399
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.000
It broke my will, but I love it so much

400
00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.300
Oh my god, a huge fireball.

401
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.060
I laughed at love and thought it was funny

402
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.300
But I changed when I met you

403
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.120
I changed my mind, this love is amazing

404
00:31:09.179 --> 00:31:11.940
Oh my god, a huge fireball!

405
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.340
Kiss me, my love

406
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.740
Oh my god, a huge fireball!

407
00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.300
Altitude 2,400… 2,100

408
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.760
Goose, I can’t grab the escape handle.

409
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.800
Escape, escape!

410
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.240
Goose, no!

411
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.120
I loved flying with you

412
00:32:41.219 --> 00:32:42.420
Everyone pay attention!

413
00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.660
Nice to meet

414
00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.240
Welcome to the special training unit

415
00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.379
Sit down

416
00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.620
I'm in charge of Naval Air Combat Development for Admiral Bates.

417
00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:03.420
You are all Top Gun graduates.

418
00:33:04.259 --> 00:33:05.520
Elite

419
00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.620
Best of the best

420
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.720
But it's all in the past

421
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.060
Thanks to the new 5th generation fighter jets, we are on equal footing with the enemy.

422
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.800
I don't know the details, but one thing is certain

423
00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.899
We no longer have a technological advantage

424
00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.320
Operation success more than ever

425
00:33:22.379 --> 00:33:24.899
Depends on the pilot

426
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.740
Only half of you pass

427
00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.720
One person becomes the operation leader

428
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.960
The other half remains in reserve.

429
00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.960
Your instructors are also Top Gun graduates.

430
00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.600
Everything about this operation that you guys need to learn.

431
00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.280
He is a person with real experience.

432
00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.460
The protagonist of legendary achievements

433
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.060
The best pilot produced by Top Gun

434
00:33:48.179 --> 00:33:50.159
Being recognized

435
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.160
His teachings

436
00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.640
It will be a great help in the crossroads of life and death.

437
00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.580
Introducing Colonel Pete Mitchell

438
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.940
Call sign is Maverick

439
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:08.639
Good morning

440
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.960
F-18 training and operation manual

441
00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.760
It has everything about the F-18

442
00:34:24.779 --> 00:34:27.540
I think you all know it well.

443
00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:28.920
- Of course. - Of course.

444
00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.300
You're right

445
00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:39.719
The enemy is the same

446
00:34:40.259 --> 00:34:41.759
It's just the beginning

447
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.020
What the enemy doesn't know is your limitations.

448
00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.540
Find the limit

449
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.280
Testing

450
00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.199
I plan to push on.

451
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.000
Today we start with what I think you already know.

452
00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.660
Show me what you guys are capable of.

453
00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.839
Rooster

454
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.000
Bradley

455
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.399
Captain Bradshaw!

456
00:35:13.259 --> 00:35:14.400
Yes, Colonel.

457
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.100
Don't do this

458
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.259
Are you going to eliminate me?

459
00:35:20.939 --> 00:35:22.620
That's up to you, not me.

460
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.280
Can I go?

461
00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.260
Good morning, guys. This is the captain.

462
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.480
Well done on basic fighter maneuvers

463
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.980
As explained, today's training is a dog fight.

464
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.720
Autocannons only, no missiles

465
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.799
Do not fly below 1,500 meters altitude

466
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.800
Come together as a team and take me down or...

467
00:36:01.919 --> 00:36:05.220
- Or what? - I'll shoot you.

468
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.220
If one of them crashes, both fail.

469
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.200
I need to crush that guy's pride.

470
00:36:10.319 --> 00:36:11.640
We'll do it for you

471
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.400
- Do you want to bet? - Have you thought about anything?

472
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.340
Whoever falls first gets to do 200 pushups.

473
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.680
Oh my god, that's a bit much.

474
00:36:19.799 --> 00:36:22.379
That's all you have to do to get training.

475
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.419
Accept the offer

476
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.759
The battle begins, let's stick together

477
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.580
Fanboy, do you see the Colonel?

478
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.700
It wasn't picked up by the radar above, so it must be below us.

479
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.960
- shit! - what?

480
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.860
This!

481
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.439
Calm down, Maverick.

482
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.560
Don't get fired on the first day

483
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.560
Red flag appears! Maverick is coming! Sharp turn to the left!

484
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.820
To the left!

485
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.900
Payback, where's your wingman?

486
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.180
- Rooster, where are you? - Stay behind me.

487
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.760
It'll go quickly, just hang in there

488
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.200
Hurry!

489
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.900
- Payback, turn right! - Sharp turn to the right!

490
00:37:08.279 --> 00:37:11.700
Rooster saved you, thanks to which he would have died.

491
00:37:11.759 --> 00:37:13.439
It won't work this time, old man.

492
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.759
Don't get caught up, Maverick.

493
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.299
Rooster, too low! I'm going to break the altitude limit by raising my altitude!

494
00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.940
- Extreme caution, extreme caution - Oh my.

495
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.340
Shot down

496
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.800
Under! 109

497
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.399
Under! 110

498
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.060
- We almost got it - 111!

499
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.560
- But you don't take it. - Down!

500
00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.140
You know what kind of person Rooster is, right?

501
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.220
112!

502
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.700
Please stay here carefully while we go.

503
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.500
Everyone come in

504
00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.360
- Dead - Damn it!

505
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.700
- Shot down - Hell!

506
00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.060
Were you excited when taking a selfie? Go down, do it!

507
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:06.960
Phoenix

508
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.900
Would you like to guess why his name is Bob?

509
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.299
- tell me? - Don't get caught, Bob.

510
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.400
Do you know why he is a hangman?

511
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.740
How do you feel about eating a lot of rice?

512
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.640
Shit!

513
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.819
Hello guys, the battle has begun.

514
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.700
Alright, let's destroy Phoenix!

515
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:27.960
Watch your back, Phoenix.

516
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.940
- Sharp turn to the right! - To the right!

517
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.359
Where are we going?

518
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.540
That's why he's a hangman. When it's dangerous, he's the only one who gets out.

519
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.000
Abandoning your wingman

520
00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.800
It's been a while since I used this tactic

521
00:38:40.859 --> 00:38:43.259
Are you going to put up with me calling you a ‘man’, Phoenix?

522
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.760
As long as you don't get called 'man'

523
00:38:44.879 --> 00:38:46.800
Bob, where's Maverick?

524
00:38:46.919 --> 00:38:48.899
Oh my god, it's already turning around.

525
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.400
Get the Maverick off, Hangman!

526
00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:54.419
Folks, this is what fossils ask.

527
00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.120
Okay, let me teach you a few hangman tricks.

528
00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.100
- It's dead, Phoenix - Damn it!

529
00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.380
It's okay

530
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.960
- Let's see what you're capable of, Maverick. - Try it.

531
00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.100
The devil goes away, the hangman comes.

532
00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.520
He's good, I admit it.

533
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.299
I can't see Maverick, what's the distance?

534
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.760
- Phoenix? - I'm dead, idiot.

535
00:39:23.819 --> 00:39:25.680
See you in the next life, bagman

536
00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.680
Where is it?

537
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.720
Shot down

538
00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.980
79, down 80

539
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.240
Who's next?

540
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.480
- Gotcha, Omaha - Damn it!

541
00:39:42.299 --> 00:39:44.520
- Coyote also died - Dead, over.

542
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.080
51, go down 52

543
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.960
Rooster: Is it okay to ask personal questions?

544
00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.340
It's not okay, isn't it okay?

545
00:39:56.399 --> 00:39:58.620
What's the story with Maverick?

546
00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.800
- He really hates it - Don't worry about it.

547
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.720
Where the hell are they?

548
00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.460
I've been here the whole time

549
00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.340
Shit

550
00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:11.640
Can you see it now?

551
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.339
Let's finish it quickly

552
00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.380
The battle begins!

553
00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.400
Why are you two like that?

554
00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.439
How are you going to come down here and get out?

555
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.080
Give up at any time

556
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.520
How much further down will you go, Rooster?

557
00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.880
I can go down as far as the colonel, you know what I mean.

558
00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.700
The past is the past, for all of us

559
00:40:41.759 --> 00:40:43.620
You might want to believe that.

560
00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.800
1,500 meters is the altitude limit, so we will leave soon.

561
00:40:47.759 --> 00:40:48.780
Extreme caution

562
00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.880
Your strategy caused us both to fall

563
00:40:50.939 --> 00:40:53.400
- Colonel, what is your strategy? - High caution

564
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.840
Extreme caution

565
00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.520
Be very careful, be very careful

566
00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.040
Be very careful, be very careful

567
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.779
Rise in altitude, rise in altitude!

568
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.460
Rise in altitude, rise in altitude!

569
00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.439
You can do it, don't think, just do it

570
00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.160
Rooster, you can shoot and catch him quickly!

571
00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:19.680
Too low

572
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.440
It's too late, I lost my chance

573
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.319
Shot down, training ended.

574
00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.420
Shit!

575
00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.400
Nothing has changed

576
00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.259
Go to Hondo and do pushups

577
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.980
Stop, that's enough.

578
00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.740
That's enough, Rooster.

579
00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.800
Do you want to get kicked out for violating altitude limits and disobeying orders?

580
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.360
Don't care

581
00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.360
I will definitely go to this operation

582
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.140
But if you get kicked out, you have to go with Hangman.

583
00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:23.400
- Why did you do that? - You rejected my documents.

584
00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.940
- what? who? - Maverick

585
00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.660
I rejected my application for admission to the Naval Academy.

586
00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.720
4 years each

587
00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.680
Why?

588
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.080
The altitude limit is 1,500 meters above ground.

589
00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.480
In addition to the pilot's safety,

590
00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.040
It was decided for the safety of fighter jets.

591
00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.360
It's not just a rule, it's an immutable law

592
00:42:54.419 --> 00:42:57.120
Actual operational flight altitude will be much lower

593
00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.300
You can never change it without my approval!

594
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.340
Especially during training!

595
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.360
Plus the Cobra maneuver? All three almost died

596
00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.340
Don't do that again

597
00:43:09.419 --> 00:43:11.700
What were you trying to teach?

598
00:43:11.759 --> 00:43:14.160
They're great pilots, but they still have a lot to learn.

599
00:43:14.279 --> 00:43:16.860
They are the best fighter pilots on earth.

600
00:43:16.919 --> 00:43:18.660
At high altitude

601
00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.640
Just dropping bombs without any close combat maneuvers.

602
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.500
It's a title I earned.

603
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.319
This is our first time doing something like this.

604
00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:29.100
Anyway, within 3 weeks, teamwork and

605
00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.260
Teach target hitting

606
00:43:31.319 --> 00:43:33.060
And a way to return

607
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.920
That needs to be taught too.

608
00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.240
Operation is fraught with risk.

609
00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.000
Even pilots bear it.

610
00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.680
Not me

611
00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.200
Every morning from now on

612
00:43:55.319 --> 00:43:58.020
Submit class content in writing

613
00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.020
Don't change anything without my approval

614
00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:04.259
- Are altitude limits included? - That's not even possible.

615
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.440
Admiral

616
00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:09.540
What is this?

617
00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.340
This is a limited altitude descent request.

618
00:44:11.399 --> 00:44:13.799
This is for low-altitude bombing training according to the operation details.

619
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.560
Learn some timing, Colonel.

620
00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.300
Coyote

621
00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.460
Look at this

622
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.940
He's a legendary man

623
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.040
No, next to it

624
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.040
Looks a little familiar, right?

625
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.580
Who is this?

626
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.600
"Lieutenant Bradshaw"

627
00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.100
'Bradshaw'

628
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.740
Unbelievable…

629
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.500
Theo, you’ve grown a lot.

630
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.419
Maverick

631
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.580
Amelia?

632
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.200
Yes, it has grown a lot.

633
00:45:04.259 --> 00:45:05.520
That's right

634
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.920
The bar opens at 5 p.m.

635
00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.740
I stopped by to pay off a debt.

636
00:45:10.859 --> 00:45:12.060
Mom!

637
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.740
- My father? - I'm in Hawaii with my wife.

638
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.240
Mom!

639
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.300
They say Maverick has trauma?

640
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.780
- It's okay, it's okay - Take it.

641
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.680
Thanks, Colonel, I'm debt free now.

642
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.560
Colonel? Still?

643
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.319
He's a colonel with many decorations.

644
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.460
Finish it

645
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.320
I'm going to take the boat and go get it repaired.

646
00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.360
- No. - Why not?

647
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.780
I have a test tomorrow, I told you today

648
00:45:48.899 --> 00:45:50.820
I can't drive it alone

649
00:45:50.939 --> 00:45:52.320
Just use the engine

650
00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.600
Why did you go for repairs?

651
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.700
- The engine broke down - That's right.

652
00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.500
Can I help you?

653
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.920
- The waves are a bit stronger than I thought. - Are you kidding?

654
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.580
Pull the mast cord to slow down the sail.

655
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.660
Okay

656
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.820
What do you mean?

657
00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.480
Weren't you in the navy?

658
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.900
I don't drive the boat, I just land on it

659
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.680
It’s similar to reducing speed by raising the ailerons.

660
00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.180
So what should I do?

661
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.180
Pull that green string over there

662
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.560
Green

663
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.640
Harder

664
00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:38.700
Turn the winch there

665
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.560
Fix the little sail

666
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.620
- Turn it around, are you okay? - huh

667
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.080
Good job

668
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.359
Now

669
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.180
Are you ready?

670
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.180
What?

671
00:46:54.779 --> 00:46:56.340
Afterburner

672
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:18.480
Now it's a real navy

673
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.540
Thanks for helping me today

674
00:47:44.279 --> 00:47:45.720
Was it helpful?

675
00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.680
Don't make that face

676
00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.060
What expression?

677
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.800
Now that

678
00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.360
Sleep well, pete

679
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.520
Hi Penny

680
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.500
Are you mom?

681
00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:21.420
Yes, I'm here

682
00:48:22.379 --> 00:48:24.120
I'll make you dinner

683
00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.200
Huh

684
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.700
“3 minutes to target”

685
00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.660
Time is your biggest enemy.

686
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.200
In the first stage of the operation, teams of two

687
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.060
It is a low-altitude flight entry.

688
00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.820
Fly through this narrow canyon and approach your target.

689
00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:45.360
Radar-guided surface-to-air missiles defend the area.

690
00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.700
Although the performance is amazing

691
00:48:48.359 --> 00:48:52.200
It is for defense above the canyon, not below.

692
00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:56.160
The enemy also knows that flying at that low is crazy.

693
00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.040
I will practice it from now on.

694
00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:04.320
Altitude during operation is up to 30 meters

695
00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.440
If it gets higher than that, it will be caught on radar.

696
00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.900
Die

697
00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.020
The lowest flight speed...

698
00:49:13.799 --> 00:49:15.060
660 knots

699
00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.520
Reach time to target 2 minutes 30 seconds

700
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:21.839
There's a 5th generation fighter jet waiting here.

701
00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:27.120
If you fight with your F-18, you will die right away.

702
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:30.840
So before the bandit notices

703
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:34.080
Infiltrate and blow up the target

704
00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.020
That's why time is your biggest enemy

705
00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:42.120
The canyon simulation is loaded into the navigation system for training.

706
00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.580
The more you speed up

707
00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:48.000
It becomes difficult to lower altitude to avoid missile radar.

708
00:49:48.359 --> 00:49:49.500
The sharper the turn, the more

709
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.800
The applied gravity is doubled

710
00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.200
Putting pressure on the lungs

711
00:49:55.259 --> 00:49:56.700
There's blood in my head

712
00:49:56.759 --> 00:50:00.000
Judgment and reaction time are impaired

713
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.460
So today is a little easier

714
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.520
It takes 3 minutes to reach an altitude of 91 meters.

715
00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.640
Good luck

716
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:16.980
"coyote"

717
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.840
1 minute 30 seconds to target

718
00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.360
I'm 2 seconds behind, turn it up to 480 knots

719
00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.680
Hurry up, coyote

720
00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:25.259
Okay, speed up.

721
00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:28.920
This!

722
00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.800
"Phoenix Bob"

723
00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.359
Why did he die?

724
00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:36.240
I was hit by a missile because I violated the 91 meter altitude limit.

725
00:50:36.299 --> 00:50:37.980
No, why did he die?

726
00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:40.380
I slowed down without warning, it's my fault.

727
00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.299
Why didn't the team communicate with each other?

728
00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.500
Too focused on flying...

729
00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.360
Would that be an excuse to tell the family at the funeral?

730
00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:47.340
No

731
00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:51.360
Didn’t you know there was a curve? You heard the terrain briefing.

732
00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.660
Not to me, but to the family left behind.

733
00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.640
Hangman, calm down. The canyon is getting narrower.

734
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.340
No, speed up the payback.

735
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.259
- Too fast - It's okay to go fast

736
00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.420
Damn it, slow down! I'm going off course!

737
00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:18.120
You might bump into something like this, be careful!

738
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:20.820
“Payback, Fanboy Hangman”

739
00:51:21.839 --> 00:51:24.540
- What happened? - I flew as fast as I could

740
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.580
Like your life depends on it

741
00:51:26.759 --> 00:51:30.000
That put the team in danger and the wingman died.

742
00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.759
I couldn't keep up with you

743
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.520
Rooster, I'm 20 seconds behind and I keep getting more late.

744
00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:44.160
It's okay, the speed is good.

745
00:51:44.279 --> 00:51:45.840
Increase to 500 knots

746
00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:48.960
- No, Yale, keep up the pace. - Rooster, you're late!

747
00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.839
You're alive, you just have to catch up on the straight section.

748
00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.460
You will fail

749
00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:56.580
Trust me, you can do it. Keep up the pace.

750
00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.780
Why did he die?

751
00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:03.060
You are the team leader. Why did your team die?

752
00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.820
Still, only Rooster reached the target.

753
00:52:05.939 --> 00:52:07.140
1 minute late

754
00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.500
It's time to be shot down by the enemy.

755
00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.420
- Dead - I don't know.

756
00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.020
You flew too late, I regret one second

757
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.340
I reached the target

758
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:21.120
And when I came out I met the red flag

759
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.240
- You can do a dog fight. - The opponent is a 5th generation fighter.

760
00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.880
- You have to stick with it to find out. - With the F-18?

761
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.460
What matters is the pilot, not the fighter.

762
00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:30.660
I know yeah!

763
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.500
There is not just one way to succeed in an operation.

764
00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.540
You don't understand at all

765
00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.200
If you don't fly like Maverick in this operation

766
00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.120
No one will come back alive

767
00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:51.240
I didn't mean to piss you off

768
00:52:51.299 --> 00:52:53.580
But it always pisses me off

769
00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:56.280
I don't mean to criticize you, but

770
00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:58.860
- You're too conservative - Captain.

771
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:03.540
This is a battle no one has ever experienced before

772
00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.180
Even that person

773
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.020
There's no time to dwell on the past

774
00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:16.140
- what do you mean? - Rooster

775
00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.840
We all know that Maverick and his father flew together.

776
00:53:18.899 --> 00:53:20.340
- Stop - No, he flew like a Maverick.

777
00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.080
-His father… - stop!

778
00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.980
- stop! -You bastard!

779
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.060
Calm down

780
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.640
I'm okay

781
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:30.540
Stop!

782
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.700
- He can't carry out this operation. - Stop it!

783
00:53:32.819 --> 00:53:34.020
You know that

784
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.100
You're right.

785
00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:45.660
Everyone disperse

786
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:03.720
"Ice: Let's meet up"

787
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.820
“It’s not a good time”

788
00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:14.580
“No please”

789
00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.360
Maverick

790
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:55.020
Did you relapse?

791
00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:57.120
No one knows

792
00:54:59.279 --> 00:55:01.020
They say there's nothing they can do

793
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.860
It's hard to even talk

794
00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.600
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

795
00:55:32.819 --> 00:55:34.080
Admiral

796
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:46.080
How have you been, wingman?

797
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.800
“Tell me about work.”

798
00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.000
Don't worry about me

799
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.819
Is there anything I can do for you?

800
00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.240
Okay

801
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:18.180
Rooster is still mad at me for what I did.

802
00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.440
I thought you would understand with time

803
00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.399
I also hoped you would forgive me

804
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.279
“There’s still time”

805
00:56:34.799 --> 00:56:36.720
Less than 3 weeks left until operation

806
00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:38.880
He's not ready yet

807
00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:44.820
“You can teach me.”

808
00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.200
Don't want my help

809
00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.660
Ice, please…

810
00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.060
I can't put someone in danger again

811
00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:55.259
Please please

812
00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.900
Instead of her

813
00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:59.520
Let me go

814
00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:17.580
“You have to forget it now.”

815
00:57:31.319 --> 00:57:33.000
I don't know how

816
00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.940
I am not a teacher

817
00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.200
I'm a fighter pilot

818
00:57:54.779 --> 00:57:56.220
He's a naval pilot.

819
00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:00.840
Not just a job

820
00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:03.660
It's my everything

821
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.140
How do you teach that?

822
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.640
Even if I could teach him, he doesn't want to.

823
00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.760
I don't even want the navy

824
00:58:14.879 --> 00:58:17.220
So you cut me off last time

825
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:22.980
I came back because you called me

826
00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.160
If you send him on this operation,

827
00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.460
I might not come back

828
00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.859
But if you don't send it

829
00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:43.380
You will never forgive me

830
00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:48.540
Either way, he'll be lost for the rest of his life.

831
00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.060
I know

832
00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.220
I know

833
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:17.040
The Navy needs a Maverick

834
00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:22.620
She needs Maverick too

835
00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.160
That's why I brought you with me in the fight

836
00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.300
That's why you're still here

837
00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:40.080
Thanks, Ice

838
00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.180
All

839
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.540
One last thing

840
00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:50.939
Who is the better pilot?

841
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.320
You or me?

842
00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:58.020
Let's not ruin the good mood

843
01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.540
Goes!

844
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.080
Okay, let's do it.

845
01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.020
Touchdown!

846
01:00:58.259 --> 01:00:59.520
Let's go!

847
01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:05.400
Careful!

848
01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:42.480
Where are you going?

849
01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.000
Hey Rooster!

850
01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.700
Admiral

851
01:02:02.759 --> 01:02:04.799
- What is this? - It's combat football.

852
01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.080
You attack and defend at the same time.

853
01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.880
Who is winning?

854
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.340
I think it's been a while since I counted the scores.

855
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.940
There's probably still some training left, Colonel.

856
01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.340
- Every second is a waste. - I know, Admiral.

857
01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.140
Then why are you playing here?

858
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.600
You said we should be one team.

859
01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.540
That's the team

860
01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.660
Cool, Bob!

861
01:04:04.019 --> 01:04:06.600
Should I go before Amelia comes?

862
01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.000
- He said he was staying at his friend's today. - That's good.

863
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.859
You and Amelia

864
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.019
Looks closer than last time

865
01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.539
- Right - How did you do it?

866
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:24.840
That kid...

867
01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:29.700
I always tried to break out of the framework I set for myself.

868
01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:32.400
Who does that look like?

869
01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.439
I finally realized

870
01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.440
I have to believe it

871
01:04:42.059 --> 01:04:44.520
To let you learn by making mistakes

872
01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.720
It's not easy

873
01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.080
What's going on with Rooster?

874
01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:01.500
I rejected his application to the Naval Academy.

875
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.240
I wasted years

876
01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:13.560
Why did you do that?

877
01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.980
After Goose's accident, his mother was against him becoming a pilot.

878
01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:26.160
He even made me swear before he died.

879
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.200
Do you know Rooster too?

880
01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.740
You're going to resent me for the rest of your life anyway.

881
01:05:36.779 --> 01:05:38.760
Should I make my own mother resent me too?

882
01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.420
It's not easy

883
01:05:48.359 --> 01:05:50.880
I wanted to fill the void left by my father.

884
01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:54.960
More…

885
01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.000
I wish I had done well

886
01:06:02.279 --> 01:06:05.099
But to be honest

887
01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.480
He wasn't ready

888
01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.759
Is it okay now?

889
01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.620
Mom, I'm here!

890
01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.820
They said he was sleeping at Karen’s house.

891
01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:26.640
He said he was sick, he had homework.

892
01:06:26.759 --> 01:06:29.160
- I have to go - I have to go.

893
01:06:29.759 --> 01:06:32.520
- did you have your dinner? - Should we eat out yet?

894
01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.580
No, I'll make dinner for you.

895
01:06:35.639 --> 01:06:36.720
Go quickly!

896
01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.600
- Wait, not that one. - What?

897
01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:43.440
You have to set an example for your daughter.

898
01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:46.019
You shouldn't let a man into your house on the first date.

899
01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.400
It's not a first date

900
01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.160
You know what I mean.

901
01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:53.879
Okay

902
01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.100
I understand

903
01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.460
Today is the last time I go out the window.

904
01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:00.960
You'll know when you see it

905
01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.460
No, really

906
01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.160
'Cause I'll never leave you again

907
01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.760
You're funny

908
01:07:08.879 --> 01:07:10.740
Hurry up, hurry up

909
01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:26.280
Don’t break my heart again, mom.

910
01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.240
Good morning

911
01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.460
The target of the attack was a uranium enrichment facility.

912
01:07:41.519 --> 01:07:43.980
Start operation sooner than expected

913
01:07:44.039 --> 01:07:47.160
Uranium ore is scheduled to arrive in 10 days.

914
01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.999
To avoid radioactive contamination in the canyon at the point of attack.

915
01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:54.720
Your operation has been moved forward by a week.

916
01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:57.599
Admiral, no one has completed the flyby.

917
01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.640
Nevertheless, it is an order to move on to the next step.

918
01:08:00.839 --> 01:08:01.800
Colonel

919
01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:07.259
Focus on stage 2 training for the remaining week.

920
01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.240
This is the most difficult step of the mission.

921
01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.100
Pop-up dive attack

922
01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.100
We need two miracles in a row here

923
01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.420
Four F-18s fly in ‘welded wing formation’ in two groups of two each.

924
01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:19.740
Teamwork is life

925
01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:22.319
Accurate control and cooperation

926
01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:25.139
It is essential not only for the success of the operation, but also for the survival of our soldiers.

927
01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.960
As you know, the facility is located between two mountains.

928
01:08:28.019 --> 01:08:32.099
During the final approach phase, it dives upside down.

929
01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.760
Lower your altitude as much as possible and use your only angle of attack.

930
01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.760
To maintain

931
01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:46.380
The target's impact point is less than 3 meters wide.

932
01:08:47.639 --> 01:08:50.519
When a two-seater fighter irradiates the center of the target with a laser,

933
01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.880
The first group fired a laser guided missile.

934
01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:57.660
Destroy the reactor by dropping it on the exposed vent hatch.

935
01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.939
This is a prelude to the second group's attack.

936
01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:02.220
This is the first miracle

937
01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.000
The second team

938
01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:07.380
Strike the final blow

939
01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:10.500
Completely eliminate the target

940
01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.080
This is the second miracle

941
01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.740
If even one team fails to hit

942
01:09:19.019 --> 01:09:19.920
I missed it

943
01:09:19.979 --> 01:09:22.020
- The operation was a failure - Damn it.

944
01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:26.519
Ital avoids collision with the mountain and rises rapidly, overcoming the acceleration of gravity.

945
01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:32.639
If it increases rapidly at that speed, it will be 8G.

946
01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.260
At least 9

947
01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:37.140
The limit for the F-18 airframe is 7.5

948
01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.580
That's the acceptable limit

949
01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:40.859
You'll have to push your limits to survive this mission.

950
01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:43.620
Even if the aircraft bends

951
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.359
In that state, it feels like I weigh almost a ton.

952
01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:51.300
The skull presses down on the spine

953
01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.480
Your lungs will explode like an elephant sits on your chest

954
01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:57.960
It's getting so hard not to pass out

955
01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.580
And the point at which it becomes most vulnerable to attack.

956
01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:06.420
This is ‘Coffin Corner’

957
01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.240
Even if you avoid colliding with the mountain

958
01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.900
As it rises at reduced speed, it is caught by enemy radar.

959
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.140
It becomes the target of surface-to-air missiles.

960
01:10:17.639 --> 01:10:19.860
You have all experienced the acceleration of gravity.

961
01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:24.240
This time, both the aircraft and the body will face their limits.

962
01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:27.120
Is this a viable operation?

963
01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:28.860
The answer to that question is

964
01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.440
It's up to the pilot.

965
01:10:41.339 --> 01:10:43.620
- Tell me what's going on, Bob - I'm 12 seconds late.

966
01:10:43.679 --> 01:10:46.380
- We have to hurry! - Okay, I'm stuck.

967
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.600
Wait, who is that?

968
01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:54.300
Blue Team, you've been spotted.

969
01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.000
- Damn it, Maverick. - What the hell are you doing here?

970
01:10:57.059 --> 01:11:00.240
The enemy is approaching for an attack. Blue Team, what are you going to do?

971
01:11:00.299 --> 01:11:03.480
10 o'clock, 32 km, 700 knots

972
01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.400
Decide, what are you going to do?

973
01:11:05.519 --> 01:11:08.220
Keep going, we're almost there. Stay focused on the target.

974
01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.519
- Turning from the north! - Ready to ascend

975
01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:13.679
- Bob, prepare the laser. - Okay, ready.

976
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.639
Blue Team, bandit still approaching

977
01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.900
Now rise

978
01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.180
Bob, tell me where is Maverick?

979
01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:29.340
8km away, approaching quickly!

980
01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.740
- Securing the target - How's the laser going, Bob?

981
01:11:38.519 --> 01:11:41.940
Aim failed! No, I can't aim.

982
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.860
No time, just drop it

983
01:11:47.099 --> 01:11:48.540
Damn, I missed it!

984
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.280
- Aiming completed - Maverick has aimed the missile.

985
01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:03.420
Shit! Dead

986
01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:06.960
Blue team, mission failed. Come down, coyote.

987
01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.580
Coyote? Can you hear me?

988
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.900
Coyote, respond.

989
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.420
Coyote, hold the level

990
01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.099
Oh my god, I lost consciousness.

991
01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:23.400
Coyote? coyote?

992
01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.680
- I'm going to fall! - I'm following you.

993
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.680
Come on, sound the alarm!

994
01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.620
Wake up, coyote!

995
01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.440
Coyote, come on!

996
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.720
- Damn it, coyote! - Increase altitude!

997
01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:45.420
- Coyote! - Increase altitude!

998
01:12:50.639 --> 01:12:52.440
Coyote, are you okay?

999
01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:55.200
Yes I'm okay

1000
01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:59.040
Okay, enough for today.

1001
01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:02.460
I almost got into big trouble.

1002
01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:03.960
Very

1003
01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:07.020
Leak! Bird crash!

1004
01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.220
Bird strike!

1005
01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:14.219
- Left engine fire occurs! - rises

1006
01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.720
Reduce the throttle and cut off the left engine fuel supply.

1007
01:13:18.839 --> 01:13:20.460
Fire extinguisher operation

1008
01:13:22.799 --> 01:13:23.820
The right engine went out!

1009
01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:25.800
Still spinning, igniting again

1010
01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.720
- Engine is on fire, don't ignite - Raise the throttle.

1011
01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:33.540
Oh my god

1012
01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:39.360
- It's on fire! - shit

1013
01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:42.180
- Engine fire, right side - Right engine fire extinguisher activated.

1014
01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.400
Phoenix, Bob escape!

1015
01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:49.680
Warning lights galore! Hydraulic system failure!

1016
01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:51.480
- Control system error - Control is not possible!

1017
01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:54.300
It's falling, Phoenix! We're going to crash!

1018
01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:57.000
Throw away the fighter plane! Escape, escape!

1019
01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.260
Escape, escape, escape!

1020
01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:01.200
Extreme caution

1021
01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:25.740
Phoenix and Bob will be watched at the hospital overnight.

1022
01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.300
It will be fine

1023
01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:32.700
Thank god

1024
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.799
I've never lost a wingman

1025
01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:39.780
You're lucky

1026
01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:42.180
This is what happens when you fly for a long time

1027
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.620
Others will be lost too

1028
01:14:49.379 --> 01:14:51.420
It's easy, I don't have a wife.

1029
01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.599
I have no children

1030
01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:57.900
Even if I die in an accident, there is no one to cry for.

1031
01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:02.520
Home

1032
01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.099
Get some sleep

1033
01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:09.840
Why did you reject my military academy application?

1034
01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:11.519
Why did you block my path?

1035
01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.480
Because I wasn't ready

1036
01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.860
Ready for what?

1037
01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:20.280
- Ready to fly like you? - no

1038
01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.020
Forget what you learned in books

1039
01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.840
Be ready to trust your instincts and just do it without thinking

1040
01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:27.540
If you think about it in the sky you'll die, trust me

1041
01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:30.540
Father believed in you

1042
01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.700
I don't make the same mistake

1043
01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.900
Maverick

1044
01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.280
Ready, aim, fire!

1045
01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:05.280
Ready, aim, fire!

1046
01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:20.519
Ready, aim, fire!

1047
01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.640
It must be very difficult mentally

1048
01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.000
Rest as much as you need

1049
01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.600
Thank you, but we don't have time, the operation...

1050
01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.760
From now on, I will take charge of the training.

1051
01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:07.799
Yes?

1052
01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:10.980
You said you didn't want to take on this job, Colonel.

1053
01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:13.440
- They're not ready. - You should have made them ready.

1054
01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.980
You must first believe in the feasibility of the operation.

1055
01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.800
What you taught was the opposite.

1056
01:17:20.639 --> 01:17:22.980
- Admiral - You're not allowed to fly, Colonel.

1057
01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.540
Forever

1058
01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.700
- Admiral - That's it.

1059
01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.260
I heard

1060
01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.740
I'm sorry

1061
01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:55.260
What are you going to do?

1062
01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.720
There's no ice

1063
01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.980
What can you do?

1064
01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.760
I have to find a way to come back

1065
01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:07.080
No, Penny.

1066
01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.200
I'm done

1067
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.260
It's completely over

1068
01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.759
Feet

1069
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.340
Even if I lose my wingman in the sky

1070
01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.800
You'll keep fighting

1071
01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:21.179
I just can't give up

1072
01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.880
These are the pilots you taught.

1073
01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.360
If anything happens

1074
01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.240
You'll never forgive yourself

1075
01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.179
I don't know how

1076
01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.760
You will find out

1077
01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.360
I believe

1078
01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.920
Colonel Mitchell is no longer your instructor.

1079
01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:52.440
As of today, we are changing our strategy.

1080
01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.960
4 minutes to reach target

1081
01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:58.380
Enter at low speed into the canyon height.

1082
01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:01.380
Maintain below 420 knots

1083
01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:04.260
Doesn't the bandit have time to attack?

1084
01:19:04.379 --> 01:19:06.840
Of course, there is a possibility of engagement with enemy aircraft, Captain.

1085
01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.020
So what are the chances of surviving a head-on collision with a mountain?

1086
01:19:10.139 --> 01:19:12.720
Attack targets at higher altitudes

1087
01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:13.980
From the heights of the northern canyon

1088
01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.500
Laser aiming will become more difficult

1089
01:19:16.559 --> 01:19:18.480
There is no need to rapidly ascend due to high gravitational acceleration.

1090
01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.820
You will be defenselessly exposed to enemy missiles.

1091
01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:27.480
Who is that again?

1092
01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.099
Mission control, this is entering Maverick Point Alpha.

1093
01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.839
Please check availability for flights

1094
01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.840
Maverick, this is air traffic control

1095
01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.519
Confirmed

1096
01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:42.000
There are no flights scheduled for today, Colonel.

1097
01:19:42.059 --> 01:19:43.260
Anyway, I'm going.

1098
01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.180
It was good

1099
01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:49.019
Set target arrival time to 2 minutes and 15 seconds

1100
01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.820
2 minutes and 15 seconds? It's impossible

1101
01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:53.460
Maverick approach to final destination

1102
01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:34.320
3, 2, 1 before start of rise

1103
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.220
Bomb drop

1104
01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.600
It's a hit, it's crazy!

1105
01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:24.480
It was good

1106
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.500
It's awesome

1107
01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:43.920
Thanks to the colonel, my position is in trouble.

1108
01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:48.120
The feasibility of this mission and the only means of return.

1109
01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.280
I proved it

1110
01:22:51.719 --> 01:22:53.400
For that

1111
01:22:53.519 --> 01:22:56.460
Steal a multi-million dollar fighter jet

1112
01:22:56.519 --> 01:22:59.400
I drove it very dangerously, it could have been completely ruined.

1113
01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:03.120
There's no more Iceman to protect you

1114
01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:06.540
I want you court-martialed

1115
01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:08.400
There was a good cause for dishonorable discharge.

1116
01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:10.560
What should I do?

1117
01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:14.700
Would we give up the lives of the pilots and the success of this operation?

1118
01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.220
Or not

1119
01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.220
Risking my career

1120
01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.040
Should I appoint you as team leader?

1121
01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.360
Admiral

1122
01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:31.080
I'm sure that's not the question you want the answer to, Colonel.

1123
01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:41.040
"Hard Deck"

1124
01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.500
Tell me, Goose.

1125
01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:18.360
Colonel Mitchell!

1126
01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.000
Now that you're back at your place

1127
01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.420
Show me properly

1128
01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.680
It was an honor to be with you

1129
01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:06.179
You all are the best of the best

1130
01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:09.720
What the operation demands is clear

1131
01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:13.860
I just made a choice that suited those needs.

1132
01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.780
Choose two teams of two

1133
01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.960
Payback, fanboy

1134
01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:21.360
Phoenix, Bob

1135
01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.000
Who is your wingman?

1136
01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:32.760
This is Rooster

1137
01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.599
The rest is in case of an emergency.

1138
01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:42.599
Wait on the ship

1139
01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:44.640
Dissolution

1140
01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:55.260
The target is a clear and present threat.

1141
01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:00.600
It is a secret uranium enrichment facility of a state sponsor of terrorism.

1142
01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.580
To the underground bunker

1143
01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:04.440
It is located between two mountains

1144
01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:09.720
The entrance road is heavily defended with surface-to-air missiles.

1145
01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:12.300
Up to 5th generation fighter aircraft are deployed.

1146
01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:15.120
When your F-18 fighter jets cross the border,

1147
01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:17.220
USS Leyte Gulf Hoga

1148
01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:20.940
Simultaneous attack on enemy flight facilities with Tomahawk missiles

1149
01:27:22.259 --> 01:27:24.420
Destroy the runway

1150
01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:29.640
You must be prepared to engage in combat with enemy aircraft that have already taken off.

1151
01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:32.520
When the missile falls, the enemy will know of your presence.

1152
01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.799
Reach time to target is 2 minutes and 30 seconds

1153
01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:40.980
If you pass that time

1154
01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:44.160
You must be prepared to be attacked by an enemy plane that Tomahawk cannot eliminate.

1155
01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:49.980
I've been training for today

1156
01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.460
To return safely

1157
01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:09.840
Show me your example!

1158
01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:23.519
Colonel

1159
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.020
Colonel!

1160
01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.260
I…

1161
01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:32.820
I want to give...

1162
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.460
Everyone ready to board

1163
01:28:41.879 --> 01:28:43.260
The story is

1164
01:28:44.759 --> 01:28:46.140
Let's come back and do it

1165
01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.360
Bradley!

1166
01:28:55.139 --> 01:28:56.100
Bradley!

1167
01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:01.019
You can do it

1168
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:10.500
Maverick

1169
01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:13.559
Maverick?

1170
01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.460
Are you listening?

1171
01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.760
Don't make that face

1172
01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:25.200
It's always like this

1173
01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:31.140
Thank you

1174
01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.740
If I don't see you again...

1175
01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:36.179
Thank you for that time

1176
01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.780
It was an honor, Colonel.

1177
01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:21.960
Dagger 1, ready on launch pad 1

1178
01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.180
Dagger spare, standby

1179
01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.040
Dagger 4, ready

1180
01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:27.660
Dagger 3, ready

1181
01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:29.820
Dagger 2, ready

1182
01:30:31.019 --> 01:30:33.660
Support team in the air Strike team ready

1183
01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:35.639
Waiting for sortie

1184
01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.259
Sally

1185
01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:59.219
Dagger 2, sortie completed

1186
01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:02.160
Dagger 3, sortie completed

1187
01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:04.140
Dagger 4, sortie completed

1188
01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:17.580
Comanche, this is Dagger 1, waiting to receive commands, standby.

1189
01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.460
Comanche 11, confirmed.

1190
01:31:20.519 --> 01:31:22.740
No red flag detected. You may continue entering.

1191
01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:24.840
Got it, Dagger falls below the team radar.

1192
01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:47.400
Dagger team drop completed Switch to E-2 radar video

1193
01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:49.019
"Dagger Team"

1194
01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:58.500
Approach land after 60 seconds of approaching enemy territory.

1195
01:31:58.559 --> 01:32:01.500
Comanche, I want you to check the Dagger 1 radar here.

1196
01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:04.379
No enemy aircraft detected. Decide whether to attack or not.

1197
01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:05.760
I get it

1198
01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:15.180
Attack begins

1199
01:32:20.639 --> 01:32:21.780
Tomahawk firing

1200
01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:23.940
There's no turning back now

1201
01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:31.740
Dagger team, switching attack formation

1202
01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:42.540
Time to reach formation completion target

1203
01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:47.460
3, 2, 1 until the timer is set to 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

1204
01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.839
- 2 settings - 3 settings

1205
01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:49.800
4 settings

1206
01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:55.680
Enter

1207
01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:13.200
First surface-to-air missile crossing

1208
01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:19.440
Looks like you flew off the radar, Maverick.

1209
01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.240
Let’s not jump to conclusions.

1210
01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:27.000
Another surface-to-air missile spotted at 3 o'clock.

1211
01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:31.680
- 2 minutes to target - Got it.

1212
01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:34.080
You're a few seconds late, Rooster, you need to hurry.

1213
01:33:35.639 --> 01:33:38.519
Tomahawk 30 seconds to hit enemy runway

1214
01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:47.940
Dagger, this is Comanche

1215
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.160
Two enemy planes detected on radar, one squadron

1216
01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:52.980
- Where the hell are you coming from? - Isn’t this a long-range reconnaissance plane?

1217
01:33:58.019 --> 01:33:59.460
Comanche, what direction is the enemy headed?

1218
01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:02.040
Proceeding southwest at 80 km in a direction of 90 degrees from the reference point.

1219
01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.200
It's in the opposite direction from us. They don't know we're here.

1220
01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.240
The moment the tomahawk falls

1221
01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.519
Bandit planes will also turn to defend their targets.

1222
01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:11.160
We have to go first, speed up

1223
01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:14.880
Okay, I'll follow you.

1224
01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:23.220
Daggers 2 and 4 are behind schedule

1225
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.980
1 minute 20 seconds to target

1226
01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.280
3 seconds, 2 seconds to hit the tomahawk...

1227
01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:36.120
Strike completed, enemy runway destroyed.

1228
01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:38.519
Now you know we're going

1229
01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:44.280
Bandit course correction moving toward target

1230
01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:45.540
Rooster, where are you?

1231
01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:48.960
Rooster, the bandit is approaching.

1232
01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:51.240
It's late, we need to catch up, speed up

1233
01:34:59.219 --> 01:35:00.240
Phoenix, be careful.

1234
01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:14.400
2 minutes to target, 1 minute for a large team.

1235
01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.800
Rooster, hurry up or you'll die.

1236
01:35:19.019 --> 01:35:21.900
I'm falling behind, I need to go fast

1237
01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.760
If you don't speed up now

1238
01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:26.640
They should go first and wait

1239
01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:29.880
Please tell me, father

1240
01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.460
You can do it

1241
01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:34.620
Don't think, just do it

1242
01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:41.760
"note"

1243
01:35:43.139 --> 01:35:44.580
Damn it, Rooster, not so fast!

1244
01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:47.220
Yeah, that's it, okay, let's go!

1245
01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:53.040
Rooster, be gentle.

1246
01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:56.339
Dagger 2 is back in action

1247
01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.800
Okay, hit the target and return.

1248
01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.940
30 seconds to target, check the laser

1249
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.540
Air-to-ground mode laser code check, code 1688

1250
01:36:09.599 --> 01:36:10.680
Laser ready!

1251
01:36:13.019 --> 01:36:14.400
Watch your head

1252
01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:17.580
Oh my god!

1253
01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:19.620
- Payback, are you following me? - Right after.

1254
01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:22.500
Phoenix prepares for pop-up attack

1255
01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:23.940
Dagger 3, ready

1256
01:36:24.599 --> 01:36:27.300
3, 2, 1 until pop-up

1257
01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.540
- Aim the laser, Bob - Dagger 3

1258
01:36:58.440 --> 01:36:59.759
Maverick, stand by!

1259
01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:02.220
- Bob, hurry - stand by!

1260
01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:05.580
- Aiming complete! - Securing target, dropping bombs

1261
01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.000
Attack complete, confirmed hit!

1262
01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.920
First miracle completed

1263
01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:34.019
Dagger 2, report the situation.

1264
01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.580
We're there, Maverick.

1265
01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:39.840
Fanboy, what about lasers?

1266
01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.540
Rooster, the laser is strange.

1267
01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:44.280
Damn it, no laser aiming!

1268
01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:46.680
Hurry up, no time, try again!

1269
01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.240
- I'm doing it! - Fanboy, quick!

1270
01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:49.980
It's done

1271
01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:01.440
- Fanboy, hurry! - No time, drop first.

1272
01:38:01.559 --> 01:38:03.780
- Rooster, wait a minute! - No time, drop it.

1273
01:38:03.839 --> 01:38:05.220
- for a moment! - Drop the bomb!

1274
01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:20.580
It's a hit, it's a hit!

1275
01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:25.860
Second miracle completed

1276
01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:27.540
Now Coffin Corner

1277
01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:29.759
It's not over yet

1278
01:38:31.559 --> 01:38:33.000
Here it comes

1279
01:38:36.059 --> 01:38:38.220
Enemy missile approaching! Phoenix, make a sharp turn to the right!

1280
01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:40.560
Emergency Release, Dagger 3 Defense

1281
01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:43.260
-Here we come again! - Dagger 1, defense

1282
01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:44.219
"flare"

1283
01:38:50.519 --> 01:38:51.600
Rooster, report the situation.

1284
01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:00.840
Oh my god

1285
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.440
Enemy missile approaching!

1286
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:07.680
- Make a sharp turn to the right, payback - to the right!

1287
01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:10.920
Oh my god, it's coming

1288
01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:12.420
Rooster, missile appears at 6 o’clock!

1289
01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:15.240
Deploy countermeasures

1290
01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:19.559
Avoided

1291
01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:22.680
Dagger 1, defend

1292
01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:27.000
- Tell me, Bob - sharp turn to the right!

1293
01:39:27.059 --> 01:39:28.559
9 o'clock!

1294
01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.380
Rooster, two more steps towards 6 o'clock

1295
01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.940
Dagger 2, defense

1296
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.840
- Payback, in front - Dagger 4, defense

1297
01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:41.519
- Rooster, write at 7 o’clock! - Bob, tell me!

1298
01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:42.960
- 6 o'clock! - Dagger 2, defense

1299
01:39:43.019 --> 01:39:44.700
- Phoenix, make a sharp turn to the right! - saw!

1300
01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.460
Dagger 2, defense

1301
01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:55.980
Damn it, flare out!

1302
01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:58.380
Rooster, avoid!

1303
01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:00.720
I can't take it off! So close!

1304
01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:08.640
Maverick!

1305
01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:12.480
Maverick, no!

1306
01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:18.000
Dagger 1 was hit. Repeat, Dagger 1 was hit.

1307
01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:19.620
Maverick was shot down.

1308
01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:20.820
Dagger 1, what is the situation?

1309
01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:22.560
The situation is!

1310
01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:24.780
Can you see it? Anyone see Maverick?

1311
01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:27.120
- Dagger 1, respond! - I didn't see the parachute.

1312
01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:28.800
I have to go back again

1313
01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:31.380
This is Comanche, bandit appears, approaching fast.

1314
01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.000
Dagger team will fly south

1315
01:40:33.839 --> 01:40:35.820
1 minute until the enemy arrives

1316
01:40:39.059 --> 01:40:40.680
Bring the power back

1317
01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:43.260
Everyone return to the entry control center. Enemy aircraft are approaching.

1318
01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:44.400
What about Maverick?

1319
01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:47.460
They say there's nothing they can do for the Maverick, not with the damn F-18!

1320
01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:50.400
We request permission to sortie reserve aircraft for air cover.

1321
01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.700
Not allowed

1322
01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:57.360
- We need to send a rescue team. - No, the enemy plane is in the sky.

1323
01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:01.019
- Maverick is there - no more lives lost.

1324
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.500
Bring it back right away

1325
01:41:04.559 --> 01:41:07.080
Dagger, no fighting

1326
01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:09.300
I repeat, no engagement.

1327
01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.420
Dagger 2, return to the aircraft carrier, respond.

1328
01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:13.500
Respond

1329
01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:17.099
Rooster, the red flag has come and we can’t be saved.

1330
01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:20.040
Rooster, Maverick is dead.

1331
01:41:21.719 --> 01:41:23.220
He died

1332
01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:54.660
No

1333
01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.880
Dagger 2 was hit

1334
01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.160
Dagger 2 was hit

1335
01:43:06.719 --> 01:43:08.100
Dagger 2, respond

1336
01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:11.640
Dagger 2, can you hear me?

1337
01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:14.580
Dagger 2, respond

1338
01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:41.100
Are you okay?

1339
01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:42.780
Yes, are you okay?

1340
01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:45.060
How

1341
01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:46.440
Why is this happening?

1342
01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:48.900
- What are you doing? - What do you mean?

1343
01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:51.360
Do you know that I was hit with a missile so that you too would end up like this?

1344
01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:53.280
I should have gone back to the aircraft carrier!

1345
01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:55.080
You saved my life!

1346
01:43:55.139 --> 01:43:58.260
I saved your life, that's all that matters!

1347
01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:00.180
What were you thinking?

1348
01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:02.280
They told me not to think about it!

1349
01:44:19.019 --> 01:44:20.099
Anyway…

1350
01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:22.799
It's nice to see your face

1351
01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:26.940
Me too

1352
01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:32.099
So what's the plan?

1353
01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.700
You're not serious, are you?

1354
01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.860
Nonsense

1355
01:45:03.839 --> 01:45:05.099
F-14?

1356
01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:07.380
I shot down three MiGs with that one.

1357
01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:09.900
Will that antique be popular?

1358
01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:14.460
- Let's check it out! - Maverick!

1359
01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:17.460
All right

1360
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.980
- There's someone over there. - Yeah.

1361
01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:32.160
- It's there too - That's right.

1362
01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:35.639
- Let's run. - Okay, run.

1363
01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:47.460
When you signal that pressurization is complete,

1364
01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:50.880
Flip this switch so it goes up to 120

1365
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.140
When the engine starts

1366
01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:54.720
Pull out all the pins and disconnect the connection.

1367
01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:56.460
- okay? - yes

1368
01:45:58.620 --> 01:45:59.640
It's okay!

1369
01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:03.720
When I go up, fold the ladder

1370
01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.679
It was good

1371
01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:16.680
Long time no see, Maverick?

1372
01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:24.720
"Engine Crank"

1373
01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:48.480
Oh my god, it's such a piece of junk.

1374
01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:50.220
It was good

1375
01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.120
-What about the canopy? - Close it

1376
01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:17.220
The runway was destroyed

1377
01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:20.040
How do I float this antique?

1378
01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:31.800
Why are you spreading your wings already?

1379
01:47:38.519 --> 01:47:41.220
This is a taxiway level, not a runway.

1380
01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:44.700
It's very short too

1381
01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:46.019
Hold on tight

1382
01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:48.720
Shit

1383
01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:56.040
Let's go, let's go! please!

1384
01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:57.180
It's almost there

1385
01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:02.880
- Maverick? - Okay, let's go!

1386
01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:03.960
Okay

1387
01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.900
- Maverick! - Goes

1388
01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:09.780
Oh my god

1389
01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:26.640
The Rooster location tracker signal is detected.

1390
01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:28.620
It seems to be malfunctioning

1391
01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:30.060
- Did you lose the signal? - no

1392
01:48:31.019 --> 01:48:32.520
Moving at supersonic speed

1393
01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:34.200
You're flying

1394
01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:37.080
- What are you riding? - Admiral

1395
01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:42.000
One F-14 Tomcat captured, flying towards us.

1396
01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:45.480
Oh my god, this is ridiculous.

1397
01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:48.180
It's Maverick.

1398
01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:52.799
Okay, contact the Rooster aircraft carrier.

1399
01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:54.300
I'm doing it

1400
01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:57.840
The radio is out, there's no radar, everything's not working.

1401
01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.840
- What should I do? Please let me know - first on the radio.

1402
01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:02.099
And…

1403
01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:05.160
Turn off the UHF-2 circuit breaker

1404
01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:06.240
Give it a try

1405
01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:09.300
There are hundreds of circuit breakers, what do they look like?

1406
01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:11.339
I don't know, it's your dad's job.

1407
01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:12.900
I'll take care of it

1408
01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:18.240
Maverick, two enemy planes appear at 5 o'clock below.

1409
01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:24.840
What should I do?

1410
01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:27.660
Listen, act naturally.

1411
01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:29.700
If you knew who we were, you'd be dead already.

1412
01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:34.019
He's coming

1413
01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:37.200
- What's the plan? - Put on a mask first.

1414
01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:40.800
First of all, we will see each other on the same side.

1415
01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:45.299
Just wave your hand and smile

1416
01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:47.520
Wave your hands and smile

1417
01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:56.460
What are those hand signals? What do you mean?

1418
01:49:56.519 --> 01:49:59.400
I don't know, I have no idea either.

1419
01:50:00.299 --> 01:50:03.660
- What about that? all right? - I've never seen it.

1420
01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:10.860
Damn, the wingman's moving into shooting position

1421
01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:13.200
Okay, listen carefully.

1422
01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.960
When you give the signal, pull the loop above your head.

1423
01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:17.639
It's an escape handle.

1424
01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:20.880
Can't you just ignore it?

1425
01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.280
Can't escape missiles and bullets

1426
01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:29.640
Then it's a dog fight.

1427
01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:33.240
Let’s fight against a 5th generation fighter with the F-14?

1428
01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:36.960
The important thing is not the fighter, but the pilot.

1429
01:50:38.519 --> 01:50:40.500
You probably wish I wasn't there

1430
01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:42.840
But you know

1431
01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:45.000
Do it, Maverick.

1432
01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:47.460
Don't think

1433
01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:49.620
Just do it

1434
01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:07.200
If you see a missile, tell me

1435
01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:13.679
- It's a missile! - Hold on tight.

1436
01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:19.019
Great, I sent one!

1437
01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:25.560
Here's one more

1438
01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:30.840
Rooster, fire flares! now!

1439
01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:35.519
Engine throttle disconnect operation

1440
01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:38.820
Turn over and go down

1441
01:51:43.139 --> 01:51:45.600
- Let's aim, aim - Aim!

1442
01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:46.620
Launch

1443
01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:54.540
What is that...

1444
01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:57.660
Shit! What is that guy?

1445
01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:01.320
Hold on, you have to lower your altitude.

1446
01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:03.720
Enemy targeting systems will be disrupted by terrain

1447
01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:06.780
Coming!

1448
01:52:19.559 --> 01:52:21.480
Rooster, where is he?

1449
01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:23.220
Still follow me!

1450
01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:32.520
- That's right! - shit!

1451
01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:40.020
- Maverick, try some tricks! - Hold on tight.

1452
01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:51.540
You're crazy

1453
01:52:58.559 --> 01:53:00.420
Aim completed, fire

1454
01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:06.120
Shit!

1455
01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:09.360
Missile runs out, switch to machine gun

1456
01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:16.860
Maverick, you can do it

1457
01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:21.120
- It was a hit! - It's not over yet.

1458
01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:25.740
"redundancy"

1459
01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:27.660
- It's your last chance. - You can do it.

1460
01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:30.060
Maverick, please

1461
01:53:40.139 --> 01:53:42.059
Done! Shoot them both down!

1462
01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:55.020
- The radio's on. - Excellent.

1463
01:53:55.139 --> 01:53:57.059
- Contact the aircraft carrier. - Okay.

1464
01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:00.480
This!

1465
01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.200
Where the hell is he?

1466
01:54:05.519 --> 01:54:07.080
Right in front

1467
01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:11.700
I'm out of ammo

1468
01:54:13.860 --> 01:54:16.200
Missile approaching! Shoot the flare, Rooster!

1469
01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:20.040
It was close.

1470
01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:24.420
I'm out of flare too.

1471
01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:30.600
Damn, I caught up with you again.

1472
01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:37.140
I can't do it.

1473
01:54:45.299 --> 01:54:47.280
- I got hit again! - No no!

1474
01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:54.360
I can't take it anymore

1475
01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:56.160
I can't escape, I have to escape

1476
01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:57.540
- yes? - Climb to escape altitude

1477
01:54:57.599 --> 01:54:59.280
Pull the escape handle when I signal

1478
01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:01.860
- Maverick, wait a minute! - There is no other way.

1479
01:55:05.099 --> 01:55:06.719
Escape, escape, escape!

1480
01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.540
Rooster, pull the handle! Escape!

1481
01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:11.220
It won’t pull!

1482
01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:23.220
Maverick!

1483
01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:26.940
Sorry

1484
01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:29.940
I'm sorry, Goose.

1485
01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:46.620
Ladies and gentlemen, I am your savior.

1486
01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:48.300
Fasten your seat belt

1487
01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:51.420
Return the shelf in front of the seat to its original position.

1488
01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:54.599
Get ready for landing

1489
01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:59.219
Hangman, you look good

1490
01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:02.639
Okay, Rooster, I'm very good.

1491
01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.179
See you on deck

1492
01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:29.580
Maverick descends

1493
01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:33.120
Remove front landing gear and tail hook loss wire and raise barricade.

1494
01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:35.280
Prepare for an abnormal landing! Put up the barricade!

1495
01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:37.740
Hurry!

1496
01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:02.400
Please don't tell me the engine died too.

1497
01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:05.099
- Okay, I won't say anything. - Okay.

1498
01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:29.820
Are you okay?

1499
01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:32.220
Yes I'm okay

1500
01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:20.400
- You added the kill record? - Now there are two.

1501
01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:23.940
There are five Mavericks, so he's the ace.

1502
01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:44.340
Colonel Mitchell!

1503
01:58:51.179 --> 01:58:52.440
Colonel

1504
01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:01.620
Thank you for saving me

1505
01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:04.920
My father would have done the same.

1506
01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:45.180
Maverick

1507
01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:47.340
Jimmy

1508
01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:49.559
If…

1509
01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:51.960
Do you have a penny?

1510
01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:55.320
I took Amelia out on a sailing trip.

1511
01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:00.180
There was no word on when you would return?

1512
02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:01.740
Yeah, there wasn't one

1513
02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.760
Would you like something to drink?

1514
02:00:19.019 --> 02:00:20.099
Here

1515
02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:12.240
“In memory of Tony Scott”
